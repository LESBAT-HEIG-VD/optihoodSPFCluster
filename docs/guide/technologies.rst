The technologies are classified in three categories:

- Energy inputs: all energy vectors that are energy sources for the systems, e.g. fuels, grid electricity, energy from the environment like solar radiation, etc.
- Energy converters: equipment that converts inputs into usable energy (heat or electricity) for the end consumers
- Energy storages: device to store electricity or heat locally in order to be consumed later.
